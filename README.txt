Prerequisites:

    node.js - version: 12.11.0 (other version are likely to work, but not tested)

The following command line commands assume the working directory to
be the root directory of the application (or this README).

Install required remote packages:

    npm run install-all

Building the client only:

    cd client
    npm run build

Now it is possible to use the client by opening the index.html inside the build directory.

Building the server and client:

    - Windows using a script:
    
        .\build.bat

    - Linux based systems:

        ./build.sh

    - Generic tutorial:

        - run "npm run build" inside ./client directory
        - create a ./build directory
        - create a ./build/client directory
        - copy server.js to ./build directory
        - copy contents of ./client/build to ./build/client

Run the server:

    - Windows:
        
        node build\server.js PORT

    - Linux:

        node build/server.js PORT

PORT argument is optional and defaults to 5000.
The application is now accesible at http://localhost:PORT.
